## About the Video Course
With our processors becoming more advanced, every company is looking for developers who can write efficient and parallel code for their services. This course will help you prepare for your upcoming interview and become a professional at writing parallel commands in JavaScript code inside a browser.

The main focus of this course is to provide you with solutions to the most commonly-asked interview questions. You will learn the concepts of parallel programming in JavaScript and take advantage of the hardware cores. You’ll understand the asynchronous nature  of JavaScript and utilize the GPU to run parallel programs. We’ll provide several techniques to achieve parallelism by implementing them in some real-life scenarios. 

By the end of this course, you’ll be confident with your parallelism concepts to solve any problem given to you during an interview. Moreover, you’ll be capable of applying your learning to other programming languages.
